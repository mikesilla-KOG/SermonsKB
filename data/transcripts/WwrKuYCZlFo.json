house we're gathered in his name amen we're here to give him praise and glory and honor and we want to hear what he has to say in his scriptures uh it is true in Isaiah chapter 5 it talks about that wonderful Vineyard it says my I can't remember my beloved has a Vineyard I can't remember but he there's a Vineyard and there's a guy who's doing a bunch of work in the vineyard and that is Jesus the Lord uh he's clearing things out and we want him to do that in our time in our America today and we need some clearing out amen you know some of us we can have stones in our ground and we don't want to be hard-hearted toward God we want to have a fertile ground in US amen so we've been talking about what shall we do in John 14: 26 it says the helper the Holy Spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you and so we want to recognize here that the spirit is not just teaching you spiritual things he's also teaching us natural things it's not just about having faith it's also about action it's also understanding truth in our time um and that means being involved in government that means being involved with what is being said out there in the messages that are being taught and preached in the world we showed you in the past we have our friend here the balader Beetle and uh the man that we had sharing about this was explaining how this beetle could not have evolved by chance right and also on the right you have that DNA replication or every right now your DNA and your cells are being replicated and this was a video we showed you that the body is doing this right now these machines are working this code is being separated so that you can make new cells your B the scriptures say you're fearful and wonderfully made and the more that they look into your body into the human into how things are done throughout the world they see a glorious masterful God at work these things these machines don't come about by accident and I know this because I work in the IT industry you can't just dream up code out of nothing we're talking about three billion lines of code the human genome has for that all to come together by chance is absolutely absurd life does not come from non-life there are no Evolutions from one kind to another in our time in America there are one million abortions every year just in our country there are 1.6 million in runaways or what they say throwaways where the parents or maybe not parents I don't know somebody's telling them get out of here and so they're going and living with a friend or whatever kids ages 10 to 17 and of course those runaways and throwaways are probably more on the older end but there're still younger ones that are running away too and so as Christians we're called to Believe In Christ we're called to grow and follow Christ as we have shared with before in past lessons we're called to be filled with the Holy Spirit as we have sung about this morning wonderful time with God in the spirit this morning as Peter States uh he said repent and be baptized and you shall be filled with the Holy Spirit right we need to do that Amen in the New Covenant says that God will give us his new spirit and that Holy Spirit uh as we read as we read before teaches us all things and so we don't want to just focus on the spiritual aspect we got to understand the messages that are out in our world today and how the Holy Spirit has a teaching has a message that is contrary amen it's contrary to Evolution it's contrary to you H being made by accident it's contrary to ending life and killing kids it's contrary to the home where 1.6 million are running away it's that's the spirit is contrary to that these Natural Things the spirit also wants to teach us these things and teaching is very important Jesus said go into all the world and what teach them everything I've commanded you it's so important that we be taught what the truth is that has the impact a good impact on the world they teaching that we evolved they're teaching that abortion is Health Care you see we we come up with words we come up with our you know how we wrap uh the message around something right how we label it but it is contrary to what the Holy Spirit In Jesus teaches doesn't come from the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit wants to teach us how [Music] to uh how to have a good effect on our home our children our family our spouse our marriage and he's coming to teach us all things I just want to make that point it's not just Faith it's not just believing it's our everyday life the results of liberal teaching we have today in our world we can see it divorce is 50% of marriages end in divorce unwed birds have risen from 2% in 1960 to 40% in our time from Liberal enablement not just teaching but we're also enabled STDs have risen from 0.03 to I don't know if that's right I need to check that but I do remember it was 1 and four 1 and four 25% have STD got to watch out it's a sexually transmitted disease are there children here oh 600,000 graduate illiterate every year and this is happening right now this stuff is going on right now it's happening in our world today and so we see the results we used to have a slogan saying Bible morality unpopular but indisputable results and when you follow the scriptures when you follow the Bible when you follow truth it blesses your life it is a blessing to you it's a blessing to your family as we learned I think last week or the week before you know they're talking about your your your vulnerability to getting uh sexually transmitted diseases goes to basically nothing when you stick with your spouse and you stay faithful to that person duh not complicated amen and we got to understand this because the Holy Spirit wants to teach too Jesus has a message that he wants to teach and there are you know conservatives and people on you know that will say oh you you know we everybody should be allowed to do whatever they want to do but God's teaching is against that we're hurting people by enabling people to do whatever they want to do it's hurting children it's hurting families and it's important that we address it Ezra chapter 10: 2 shechaniah spoke up and said to Ezra we have trespassed against our God we have taken Pagan Wise from from the people of the lands yet now there is hope in Israel in spite of this and so here we have a time in Israel where they messed up and they came before Ezra who was in charge and he's seeking God and he wants things to change and they come and they admit that they had had done wrong and so we must recognize our trespass and what we need to change and that's what we're praying for we need that thorny ground the bony ground in us and in in the world we want it to change we want it to be transformed so that we can acknowledge yeah we've trustpass these rocks shouldn't be here these Thorns this is not the place for them right and when we do this there is hope there is hope we have hope in God and as we grow as Christians grow it's going going to affect the people around us you see as you change your ground it's going to affect the people next to you amen or it will give him opportunity to change and that is also important Nehemiah chter 8: 5 Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people he blessed the Lord the great God and all the people answered amen amen while lifting up their hands they bowed their heads and worshiped the Lord with their faces to the ground he just opened the book he opened the book where's who's got their book today man I don't have my book how could I do that I came in about the book and I was excited got the and I didn't bring my book open that thing yeah I remember using that Bible when I was a kid open it yeah right there they just opened the book and this wonderful thing happened they began to bless the Lord they began to worship God and give honor and glory to God when they open the book the book The Bible God's word is powerful and as I said before Christ reminds us that we must teach what he has commanded and they hadn't even read anything from the book just when they opened it they began to worship and to praise and to lift up the name of Jesus the word is powerful Jesus said I am the way the truth the life and no one comes to the father except through me Jesus is that truth amen he is that seed you know he's out there he's the lord of the Harvest and he's getting these stones out and he's throwing the seed in there which is the word which is him he is majorly involved in this growth I am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me John 1:14 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us talking about who talking about Jesus Christ powerful and so the parable of the swer that word that seed is Jesus himself being spread out he wants to grow in you and so we can't separate the Bible from the person of Jesus and they Rec when these people uh when the book was open they went down on their knees and they worshiped the Lord they didn't worship Ezra they didn't worship the leader as we have t been talking about they worshiped who who Jesus they worshiped God and we don't want to be worshiping leaders as wonderful as leaders are or can be or may not be John 4:23 but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit and in truth this John 4:23 is red letters I did not put it in Red Letters my fault but it's so important every when these messages that come through I'm reminding you all the time and in different scriptures that we want to be worshippers worshiping God and it says that the father is what seeking such people what kind of people worshippers that will do what worship Him amen amen amen goodness gracious man I want to get on board Jesus in red letters is talking to the woman at the well is saying hey there's coming a time when the true worshippers worship the SP father in spirit and truth I want to be with those true worshippers don't you want to be with them Father is seeking I want I want God seeking for me I want God looking for me Michael where you at we're going to be going worship I'm right there God is spirit and those who worship Him must Worship in spirit and truth I encourage you let's not waste any opportunity to worship God don't waste an opportunity to worship God don't waste an opportunity to praise God especially when you go to church you know wherever you go when you're here worship God you know sometimes we may be off up here I may be singing the wrong key I may send you off and you know keep worshiping God Amen a worshipper can worship through that somebody it's like hey what are you doing up there I can't worship yeah it's and it's tough sometimes when we make it hard but nor no no today we had a great time worshiping amen and we want to encourage you keep it up keep going we want to keep seeking after the father uh I'm sorry he's seeking for worshippers we want to be in that number and we can improve in this area amen we have if we have a little stones in the worship area of our life we can try to get those out if we got a little Thorn hey got a little thornage in My Worship for Jesus get that thorns out of there right yeah Nehemiah 8:7 also jeshua Bay sheriah Jamon Jamon acob shab hadijah massia khita Azariah jezeb Han Hanan P oh my goodness too many I can't pronounce all these names and the Levites helped the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place we're talking about Ezra here same story Ezra opened the book and he starts speaking and then and then others also helped all these people here whose names I can't pronounce and the Levites as well they helped the people to understand and the people stood in their place and they read distinctly from the book in the law of God making it what clear do we have a clear understanding when we talk with people can we share a clear understanding of the scriptures giving the meaning to help them understand the reading so important you know we're not dependent on the pastor we're not dependent on the leader we can learn God's word we can know God's word like these all of these people here you know I never heard of jesua bay I don't know who these guys are ever heard of them I've heard of Ezra because there's a book right but I ain't never heard of no KH who's khita but they were sharing they were helping people understand and that is the goal that God has for his church for his people to gain understanding and help others understand and these folks here they were not speaking a different message they were United amen they were on the same page and we want to be United amen teaching the same uh truths from the scriptures and so with this Unity the people understood they helped them understand does anybody know who this is this is our secretary of defense currently and so we have a question for you if Canada country above us if you guys didn't know Canada Rises up against us and sends troops to invade the USA now I know they wouldn't it's no fictitious hypothetical situation would we send this guy down to the border to fight they say hey get down there superhero Pete no no what do we need we need what soldiers we need troops we need people they need battalions they need special forces to meet the threat amen and it's the same way in God's house you know God's goal is for leaders to get the people disciplined and ready to fight and so this is the key this is the uh key ingredient is that the people in fighting B I'm sorry God wants to TCH turn the church into spiritual soldiers using spiritual weapons to fight the spiritual battle we've wrestled not with flesh and blood but against principalities and powers of Darkness but the thing that we wrestle with a lot right now is the message we're we're having to fight against a message of untruth and we have to meet that message with what weapon what weapon the word why what is the word called what weapon is it called The Sword how do you go up to some I mean you can get your fist but the Bible doesn't talk about fist it talks about what the sword the sword of the spirit the sword it's that word you've got to we've got to know his word we've got to understand it amen am very important and uh this example uh you may think that I'm saying that we need to get violent that's not what I'm saying at all because we're talking about the military I'm talking about we need to get violent with in the spirit we need to get serious about God's word we need to get serious about understanding it we need to get serious about seeking him praying to him and meeting that message that is being preached out there and I say it's being preached because they're speaking it it needs to be met with God's word and God's truth amen o o sorry and we just want to remind you God's goal and his transformation for us is where whatever state we are in maybe we're at the hardest uh or most sickly place he wants to bring us to a strong Soldier amen remember that's God's goal for you he wants you to become a new creation if anyone one is a Christ they are what a new creation old things have pass away all things have become new and of course I'm talking about spiritually you want to be spiritually strong amen Nehemiah 8:10 he said to them go your way eat the fat drink the sweet and send what portions to those for whom nothing is prepared for this day is Holy to our Lord do not sor sorrow for the joy of the Lord is our strength the joy of the Lord is our strength amen and all the people went their way to eat and drink to send portions and rejoice greatly because they what understood the words that were declared to them so important you know God's goal is not that we just be changed ourselves but also that we can prepare something that can be sent a portion that can be sent to those who have nothing prepared amen Matthew chap 24:12 because of lawlessness will abound the love of many will grow cold whoever's uh whoever is not with me is against me whoever does not gather with me scatters Revelations 3:15 I know your works you are neither cold nor hot would that you either um because you are lukewarm NE neither hot nor cold I will spit you out of my mouth you see our friend here he's drinking some cold coffee he doesn't like it or who knows but the love whether folks that are maybe have nothing prepared they may be in a cold State they spiritually they may be in a warm State spiritually because lawlessness Brown the love of many will grow cold we don't love being cold is not good right right love should be nice and hot and good yeah we want to burn for God amen amen whoever is not with me is against me very important we don't want to be against God because we're not with him we understand that as young people we can decide to not be with God as older people you can decide to kind of neglect God and not be with him not be on his side and so you know through our neglect and through our rejection we become against God whoever is not with me is what against me and whoever does not gather with me scatters should we be gathering for Christ yes that's what we're doing this morning we are what gathered gathered in his name we don't want to be scattering Hallelujah so the cold the lukewarm you know maybe we got some lukewarmness in us they they need a portion they need a portion of the scriptures they need a portion of Truth they need a portion of Love they need a portion from from God's house from God's people these people that understood these people that gained understanding they didn't just keep it to themselves they G they they got a portion together and gave it Matthew 13:3 Behold a s went out to sew and as he sewed some seed fell by the wayside some fell in Stony places where it didn't have much Earth when the sun came up it was scorched because they had no root and some fell among Thorns the Thorns sprang up and choked them and so the unprepared need portions from the church we can't act like we're better than people we can't act like we're better than the lukewarm or the cold maybe we are lukewarm or cold we can't act like we're better than anyone else because we they got stones in their heart or their hard heart toward God or uh the thorns in their lives are choking them we can't act like we're better amen we've got to approach with a humble attitude and love that's why love is so important you know we can lovingly uh not thinking we're better than people here here's a portion of the word here's the truth here this is going this this life is going to set you on a a harmful path it's going to hurt you it's going to hurt your family you don't want that for the sake of your future and of course people can reject the portion but it is our responsibility to give them that portion amen whether they accept it or reject it and we don't have to mistreat anyone while we're giving them a portion so what shall we do what are we teaching what teaching are we listening to what teaching are we sharing with others are we the people transforming into a new creation and what can we do to send portions to those who have nothing prepared amen we want those who are not as we have been uh sharing with and uttering earlier in worship that we want that ground transformed amen that ground that is Stony that ground that is storny we need God to transform it into good ground so so important so I know that we've had a good time during worship seeking God but in closing uh we want to spend some time responding we want to respond and recognize are we following God's teaching are we following what we want are we willing to give portions to those who have nothing prepared amen so let's take some time will you stand with me as they sing this song Here we need a change in our generation and we want God to transform our lives and the lives in America we need him to do that transformation amen amen those online and we want to thank you for joining us we trust you heard the word this morning and that you'll be praying that God would transform the ground to a good ground that we want to become a good ground ourselves amen God bless you those on live stream have a great day and thank you for joining us"}
