{"video_id": "q-cbUzdylx8", "title": "Crime part 1 — March 9, 2025", "published_at": "20250309", "transcript": "I've got a uh an example of a country today I want you to think about what it what country it may be by the third slide I want you to give me your guess but this country is a small country they had a civil war from 1979 to 1992 and I bring this up because this is a recent event wasn't thousands of years ago so this is a recent event and there was a civil war between the government of this country and uh leftist gorillas as they call them gorillas not the gorillas animals but uh people that were fighting Rebels there you go 75,000 people died in this Civil War the war shattered the nation's economy and fabric social fabric 2% of the population had 95% of the country's income and people lived in poverty there were no job very few jobs and not a lot of stability 100,000 plus fled to the United States and the Youth of that of the nation that came over from the country to the United States formed gangs and the gangs grew and in Los Angeles after the war ended in 1992 4,000 gang members were deported back to that country and in the country the government did not control them the gang members that were deported back and the gangs Grew From 4,000 to 60,000 members by the 2000s the 2000s this is recent from 4,000 to 60,000 members these gains controlled 247 of the 26 2 municipalities of this country by 2016 that's recent right they extorted vendors businesses they killed with impunity they didn't care they just killed people they forced kids to join or die and in 2015 the nation hit a peak with 6,656 murders and a population of 6.5 million this nation had the highest homicide rate in the world at one murder every hour the average person couldn't cross the street and I bring this up next time next week I'll give you the the story what happened which is uh it's a really good story powerful story but I'm just showing here that this nation was overwhelmed by crime and God in the scriptures he deals with crime and he deals with these things for the sake of the people right uh government is a very talked about Topic in the Bible and it's important that countries no matter where you're from throughout the world if you implement and follow what the Bible says to do on government you can have a blessed Nation so crime is a violation of a statute or regulation something enacted by human government that causes harm to the public or an individual within society and normally there are consequences associated with crimes uh you know if we drive too fast they say it's dangerous so they give you a ticket that's a consequence if you hurt someone uh there's all kinds of crimes there's there's a lot in our country and in our state um and we'll get into that a little more but that's what a crime is the Bible defines sin the same way as crying and so God has what he calls sin we call it what crime God calls it sin and sin it says in 1 John 3:4 whoever whoever commits say it with me sin also commits what lawlessness and sin is lawlessness or sin is crime the word is anomia maybe I'm saying that wrong meaning a transgression or violation of God's law so sin is a or lawlessness is a violation of God's law and so just like in a country you can commit crime violating the laws of the country and hurt people in your existence on this Earth under the Commandments of God you have a choice whether you're going to follow his Commandments or not and if we don't we are breaking his law we are committing sin and crime against God Matthew 7:23 then I will declare to them I never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness it's important that we understand that God is serious about us breaking his laws there is a and this is Matthew 7:23 this is Jesus talking this is red letters I never knew you depart from me you who practice ice lawlessness Jesus Christ is talking about the end he's talking about Judgment Day in red letters he's saying hey you're going to stand before me and if you're someone who's practicing lawlessness I'm going to say depart from me so you need to know what the law is and how to follow it amen you know this this this changing saying we don't have any law to follow because we're under grace it it may not be what you think especially when Jesus says if you're practicing lawlessness and you come before me I'm going to say depart from me you understand that's powerful you might have to hear that again Matthew chapter 13:41 the son of man will send out his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and those who practice lawlessness so there's some things in here that these scriptures are bringing up uh again this is Red Letters Matthew 1341 that's Jesus talking so you see the word offend right what is the fear of God in the Old Testament fear of God is to depart from Evil the fear of God is this desire not to offend who God do you have the fear of God do you care about offending God the fear of God by the fear of the Lord men and women depart from Evil that's what the scriptures say and so that's what it's talking about angels are going to gather up his kingdom all things that offend and those who practice laws and he's not it's not a good end for them we we don't want to be Lawless breaking committing crimes against God Amen simple and so in 1 John 3:7 we see here that sin and crime are the same there are different consequences for different types um and also there are solutions right if we go too fast on the highway we get a ticket there's a conse quence amen and if we break certain things there's a consequence and what can we do about it we can repent for that's the great thing about Christ and that's why he died on the cross for our sin you can you can there is a solution to our crime and that is to repent amen and he will cover you he has great solutions for our spiritual crying Genesis 4:3 Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat and the Lord respected Abel and his offering but he did not respect Cain and his offering and Cain became very angry and his countenance fell and so here in this example we have Cain he brought an offering he did something you know he thought was good and Abel brought something and God respected Abel's offering and did not respect Cain's offering and so what starts to arise in his heart what is it anger anger and Cain is jealous and coveting what Abel has Abel has respect from God and so he's feeling he's coveting he's saying oh man I want that and I can't stand my brother and so he gets angry and in Cain's mind his anger was without oh let's read Matthew chapter 4 5:22 I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and so here Cain is angry with his his actual brother now in the red letters here is talking about the Brethren God's people right uh and your family sure but and it says without a cause and here Cain he thinks he has a cause you know he hurt me Abel uh he felt cheated he felt cheated by God he he it started to Fester into hatred and that's why it's important that we can't live based on how we what feel if we live and act and speak based on how we feel we can end up feeling all kinds of things and if you let your feelings rule you you're going to end up hurting people so how does God respond to Cain's feelings so the Lord says to Cain why are you angry and the psychologist would say you can't ask me why I'm angry I'm just this is how I feel I can't change the way I feel oh okay God is talking now it's important that we look at when God has a conversation with somebody it's not like hearing job and the friends talking and the friends that are talking you can't take their word as gospel but when God talks it's time to listen amen and God says to Cain why are you angry why is your countenance Fallen if you do well will you not be accepted so God there's a little uh details here that are not in the story that would maybe clarify this but basically God is did not respect his offering and Cain is upset he got hurt and we get hurt amen does that mean that we quit does that mean that we give up does that mean we get hurt and angry Cain got his feelings hurt bad and wanted someone to pay did God apologized to Cain for hurting his feelings no God did not apologize to Cain why because God is telling Cain the truth and and so that's why it's important for us to be for Christians to be in God's word daily so important if you want to follow Christ and serve Christ you've got to get that word into you on a daily basis kanaine is is having this problem because God is speaking to him and he doesn't like it but you see when you get baptized and you are a Christian you're saying I'm going to follow Jesus I'm going to listen to what he says I'm going to obey it amen and so we want to be in that word daily and we want it hitting us and we want it coming through us and we want it challenging us so that we can respond rightly to God's word it's our choice but that's the goal if you do not do well sin lies at the door and its desire is for you but you should rule over it was Cain ruling over it and so here oh also in the New Testament James chapter 125 he who looks into the perfect law of Liberty and continues in it and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the word this one will be blessed in what he does so Cain had his moment where he is looking into the perfect law of Liberty God is talking to him it's the perfect voice God himself is speaking to Cain and he has a choice am I going to continue in God's word or am I going to continue in my feelings and God says to him you should rule over it don't let your feelings r rule you rule over your feelings and so the solution here was to rule over it to change to repent to give up the anger you know Cain could have said you know God I messed up hey how can I present a sacrifice an offering that you will accept right it's that easy you know you've got to admit and yeah it hurts you know okay I I got hurt for uh five minutes all right what can I do now right what can I do am I going to continue in my feelings or am I going to continue in the perfect law of Liberty Hallelujah I agree amen now Cain talked with his Abel his brother it came to pass that when they were in the field C rose up against Abel his brother and killed him and he didn't just think murder he committed it it wasn't in his heart anymore it wasn't just an emotion it wasn't just thoughts his thoughts turned from thoughts to emotion to being hurt and then to what committing a crime a crime now I I have this question did Cain have the Bible did Cain have the Torah did Cain have the Ten Commandments did Cain have the Bible did he have the Bible new testament old testament no but what did he have he had God's voice speaking to him directly telling him hey you're about to commit a crime and God's message is consistent that same message he spoke in Genesis is the same message he spoke in the New Testament you see Jesus is the same yesterday today ever the word is the same yesterday today he comes thousands of years later he tells the same message you've got to rule over sin it starts in your heart can you imagine Cain going around angry hating I just want to kill everybody does God want you living like that no let alone committing what comes after anger right you want to deal with what's going on in your heart that's what Jesus is talking about and that's what God is talking about to Cain so he didn't just think murder he committed it he committed a crime he broke the law abortion today is our best example of this we make excuses to murder kids in the womb you know Cain has had his excuse I am hurt I felt hurt I got hurt I got angry you don't understand I was drunk you know we come up with all of our excuses abortion oh well they they're not going to survive with me uh I'm in a tough spot you so I just kill them nine states in our United States of America have no limit on when an abortion can be done and so also another question about Cain what government was there at the time Cain was the son of who Adam Adam was the first what person on the earth Cain is his son there's two generations that's it that's all the people that are on the earth did they have a government did they have a republic did they have uh you know a Socialist Communist economy no they had who God they were under God's Authority was there a law written at that time no what law law did Cain break he broke God's word what law did Adam break and Eve they ate the fruit right they just ate the fruit I I I go to that all the time they just ate the fruit because people would be like oh my come on it's not a big deal they just ate the fruit but you know God is standing there saying don't eat this fruit and they did it I mean that's a big problem I just when somebody says you know you don't have to obey God's voice I I can't do that we can't do that and so I bring this up because California has l C to uh allow killing babies for any excuse at any limit does that make it okay why because it breaks God's law that's right and so it's important Ephesians chapter 4:14 says we shall no longer be children tossed about to and fro and carried about by every wind of Doctrine by the trickery of men and the cunning craftiness of dece plotting till we all come to the unity of the faith of the knowledge of the Son of God to be a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ you know as time goes by a country can make all kinds of laws and the Constitution is a great thing but they every state has a constitution their own Constitution and they can make laws when they make their laws does it mean that they're right you know if if if alcohol is legal and marijuana's legal that should I do it because they say I should do it should I go around boarding kids because they say it's okay because they came up with a new law no and that's the other part of this we can't just follow the wind of opinion the wind of doctrine that comes in in each state in America the wind of Doctrine in Europe the wind of doctrine of another Nation we've got to follow the thing that doesn't change that stays the same yesterday today and forever and that is Jesus Christ the word of God Romans chapter 13 verse1 let every soul be subject to the governing authorities th uh verse two those who resist will bring judgment on themselves for rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil do you want to be unafraid of the authority do what is good and you will have praise from the same if you do evil be afraid see this is this is important because if a country starts making laws that it is evil to do what is good who are we supposed to follow if a country makes a law that punishes someone who's doing good and rewards the evildoer who are we supposed to follow see that's what the the scripture is saying do what is good do what is good according to what people say do what is good according to what what God and his word and his law and you will have praise from the same if you do evil evil according to whose standard according to the state according to the country no according to God and so when somebody throws this verse to you and says shut up Christian just do what we say you got to come back and say no I don't think the government is supposed to do what is good the government is supposed to be a terror to evil not to good works I have a picture here of some ladies in Massachusetts uh they formed a uh a human chain you know they held arms like this in front of an abortion CTIC and I look at these ladies I'm like you know I can get through them no problem right you know if I really wanted to I got no problem getting through these ladies they're not going to stop me but what they're saying is hey we're not going to stand for this anymore we're going to you know we're going to block you we're going to we're going to tell you there's a better way and I don't have the video I don't know what happened but I can't imagine these ladies going that crazy right uh there were four of them that were they were among 10 protesters 10 how many people are 10 10 wouldn't wouldn't fit from here to there that's that's 10 I can get around 10 right if I really want an abortion I can get around 10 and I say this because they lock these women up and they're in prison because they broke the freedom of access to Clinic entrances Act they came out with a law and so we have a law in the state of Massachusetts that says you can't stop somebody so we're going to throw you in jail is that right is that rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil is that right do they get to throw this verse at these ladies these Catholic ladies no so to me this is very extreme and I'm trying to find my notes Here on what happened it happened in October 20 22nd 2020 they participated in a human chain in front of an abortion clinic uh because you know Catholics are very strong on on not having abortions and they were among 10 of the protesters who participated and they I know uh at least a couple of them were in prison for two years two years for for standing in front of a clinic you can't pray before the flood Cain was judged by God in Genesis 6:5 the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and he brought the flood so God directly handled judgment Before the Flood and yes he uh he judged all of mankind except for Noah and his family and any anyone willing to get on the what the ark if everybody wanted to get on the ark they would have had been what saved but they didn't get on the ark they did what they wanted to do and it's the same way in the end God is going to end all things and judge all mankind uh and we will stand before him we will all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ very important to understand that After the flood in Genesis 9:5 whoever sheds man's blood by his blood shall be shed for in the image of God he made man so after the flood God gave mankind the responsibility to judge and so when you see these stories about people kids getting raped kids getting dismembered cut into pieces destroyed hurt all kinds of awful things and people will say oh my goodness how could God allow all of this no the question is how can we allow this it doesn't have to be this way it's because we're not taking care of things it's because we won't do something about it we're refusing you know whatever your country is and whatever the laws that you're in mankind has a responsibility to judge it is up to us God has given it to us and so we got to stop blaming God for the world's evils he's placed responsibility in our hands and we're not handling it the atheist will say this question if God is God why why does he allow this we have a responsibility so this also confirms that long before uh Roman uh and America's constitution of government by law God set up government by law right after the flood and gave it to mankind God set up government by law in the time of Moses when he gave Moses the law amen oh boy and so God's Constitution is not to have any other gods before him love God Alone not to have any Idols worship him and him only uh have no make no graven image you see it's important that we don't participate in these witchcraft things witchcraft witchcraft is like idolatry you know we we get the the horoscopes out we we check that stuff to see oh what is going to happen to me today and and and we go to the the psychic and that's not good you know we participate in some kind of sorcery which you know a lot of the time doesn't have any power don't misuse his name says do not take the lord's name in vain amen and so his name is a sacred and also on top of that we do not take on his name name as Christian you see Jesus Christ the Messiah right we say we are what Christians we don't take on that name in vain if we walking out of here and taking on the name of Christian in vain meaning just so that we can tell people we're Christians that is wrong if we have no intention of loving him loving him back caring about what he says and following him we are breaking that commandment six days shall you work and on the seventh keep it holy you know let's keep a day holy we don't go and and on our rest day and and Live It Up in sin keep it holy and work Christians we got to work honor your parents honor your parents this is the first commandment with promise honor your father and your mother amen it's important the way we talk to people especially our parents honor means you know show some respect you know a just just try it a little bit you know kids teenagers young people have a little respect toward your parents show them some love you know if you love your mother and father even you know what whatever the past is or may be what may have happened you want to live a life that is Honorable to them you know my name is Michael Sila that mean I am the son of Lucio Sila and Kathy Sila and I want to honor them and honor God I learned a long time ago that I didn't have to spend time honoring them because if I just honored God it would honor them right and so if you spend your time honoring God it will honor your parents murder adultery stealing no lying no bearing false witness you know people will come up with lies and deceit turn people against each other with all kinds of lies and it's not right you're breaking God's ten commandments coveting like Cain here he was coveting what Abel had and instead of taking responsibility he tried to take it for himself sa King Saul did the same thing God approached him and said that you know you don't have the kingdom anymore and Saul he wanted to keep it he wanted to keep his position he coveted it he wanted to keep it he coveted what David had right the whole law has 600 plus commands in the Torah and all the prophet sorry I don't know where that came from so all 600 plus commands in the Torah and in the prophets in Romans chapter 13:10 love does no harm to a neighbor therefore love is the Fulfillment of the law meaning you know today you don't have to go home start finding where are the 600 commands in the Torah you know over time yeah you can read the Bible and you'll get them but what you can do is what love is the Fulfillment of the law so if you focus on love treating people not harming anyone you will fulfill all of those commands that were spoken by God love is the Fulfillment amen it says at the bottom here on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets loving God and loving your neighbor those are the two Commandments and so if you focus on those two can you remember two things we can remember two I can remember two things and I don't I have a bad memory every time I go to work I'm at the end of the day I can't remember anything but I can't remember two things the two greatest things in the whole wide world the first is to what love God and I tell you our love is evident worship today is a is an opportunity to show what love to God afterwards we're going to respond to him and and and come before him and pray and that's an opportunity to what love God I love him therefore I want to keep his Commandments and I also want to worship him I want to hear I want to respond Cain is the one who had a hard heart do I want to be like Cain I want to respond don't you want to respond so you don't have to spend a lot of time trying to understand and go to uh the the uh what are they called the Jewish priests what are they called I can't remember the rabbi where's the rabbi at I need to get all 600 please I need the list you can go home with these top two Commandments and start changing the game in your your life you can start affecting your family for good you can start affecting your home for good you can start affecting your relationships for Good by loving and if you want a definition of love it's in 1 Corinthians chapter 13 Romans chapter 138 oh no when anything except to love one another for he who loves another has fulfilled the law again it confirms what we're saying see adultery wrecks families does that harm a family adultery yes murder ends lives obviously stealing what is not yours hurts and harms right so we see the Bible is consistent The Ten Commandments are consistent with this whole idea lying destroys trust is it harming yes sometimes I I have to not say stuff but I'm not going to sit there and lie to you if I if I can't tell you something I'm just going to like I'm sorry I can't answer that question unless I'm under the court of [Laughter] [Music] law if you if we love God we don't need a rule saying no Idols because we don't love the idols we love who God that's why love is this fulfillment so so powerful uh if we hurt our neighbor and cheat them and steal from them and uh Rob them slander them that is obviously breaking God's law and of course we want to know what the outcome Romans chapter 6:23 I heard it a little differently uh recently the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our lord the wages here is is talking about what you have earned the wages I have what have you earned with your sin you've earned death you've earned it because of your behavior you've earned it because of the way you acted you've earned it the because of the way you rejected and so it's not you know it's not unfair you earned this God is Not unfair America is very uh always looking for the ROI who can tell me what Roi means return on investment that's right what is the return on investment what is the wages what is earned from sin what is the ROI death I don't want that Roi is that a good Roi no do I need a PowerPoint presentation to go through that Roi and show you how the percentages don't match up and you don't want to go to hell obviously right but what uh we want to put and invest in the scriptures say you're going to reap what you sow right and so we want to s what is true we want to S uh in the scriptures that good ground is the word of God that goes in that good ground amen we want to put God's word into that good ground seow his word so that it Springs forth life the way the truth and life if we sow our opinion if we sow somebody else's opinion if we sow what we think is right then we're going to get something else and death and Hades were cast in Lake of Fire this is the second death anyone not found not written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire how many want your name written in the book of life amen and Jesus said to his disciples uh be happy and Glory that your name is written in the book so his disciples were in the book and if you become a disciple you get your name's going to be written in the book uh as we close here we're going to be taking communion in just a minute I'm going to ask the Mr Thompson to get the communion ready if you can start passing out the elements Titus Chapter 2:14 what can we do what are the solutions who gave himself for us that he that we he might redeem us from our every Lawless deed and purify for himself his own special people zealous for good works God has given himself for us to redeem us so obviously his death on the cross his sacrifice for our sin is number one that blood is so powerful it can cover you and cover your sin Hebrews chapter 10:17 their sins and their Lawless Deeds I will remember no more and Hebrews chapter 10 10:17 is quoting Jeremiah and and Jeremiah is talking about the New Covenant and so we have an unbreakable Covenant and promise from God that if we follow him partake of him that he is promising that our Lawless deeds will be remembered No More Jesus said to the woman in John chapter 8om where are your accusers has no one condemned you she said no one Lord and Jesus said to her neither do I condemn you go and crime go and sin no more let's stop the crime sin no more amen will you stand with me we're going to begin we're going to get ready for taking communion I'm going to invite Carmen up my wife and she's going to lead us here in communion yes let me let me let me finish El Salvador's chaos shows the costs the effects of crime Cain rejected God's call to rule over sin what will we do ladies and gentlemen over here excuse me pardon me let's have manners the scriptures say do everything decently in an order and I want you know dur during the service if we can keep the attention on God's word this is God's time can we do that thank you sir Cain rejected God's call to rule over sin what will we do we saw the outcome of that amen Christ redeems the Lawless and so if you have committed a crime Christ is our solution when we love others and ourselves love is the Fulfillment of the law so the way that we can stop committing crime against God Is by loving him and loving our neighbor will we repent and rule over sin like the woman Jesus said to her go and sin No More Jesus said said to Cain hey we need to rule over that amen I'm going to hand it over to Carmen she's going to lead us in taking communion so will you stand with me so this morning I'm going to lead you in a prayer before communion we're going to do something a little different um we're going to look at the scriptures and we're going to see what the scriptures say about about taking communion and how to do it these are instructions from the Lord so in First Corinthians um you can just see up here what it says it said therefore whoever eats this bread and drinks this cup of the Lord in unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup so before we do that we're going to thank the Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for these
