{"video_id": "6_SjuUA7tq8", "title": "Crime, Like Cancer — March 16, 2025 pt 2", "published_at": "20250316", "transcript": "last week we talked about crime part one this week we're going to be talking about crime like cancer it's okay don't be scared if you look at the uh picture there it's a picture of some cancerous cells on the skin they're they're going crazy over there they're not normal you see the normal skin it's nice and healthy and then you hit that spot where it's doing damage and a normal cells over on the left cancerous cell on the right last week we uh showed in the Bible the Bible defines sin the same way as crime in 1 John 3 chapter 4 sorry chapter 3:4 says whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness and sin is what lawlessness or crime and the word lawlessness meant transgression or violation of God's law so crime is a violation of a uh natural law or some law in the state or government and sin in the Bible is a transgression or violation of God's law amen James chapter 1 verse4 each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires oh boy that's hard to read drawn away by his own desires and enticed then when desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown brings forth death sounds a lot like cancer cancer starts uh undetected can start undetected in the body and then if it if the immune system can't get a hold on it and stop those bad cells it can be undetected and grow and as it grows it can lead to what ultimately leads to death many people have come down with cancer leading to death right and so it's pardon me desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown brings forth death Matthew chapter 26 41 watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak so in the Natural Body cancer begins as a single mutated cell and unnoticed it will cause a crisis in your body and sin is very similar it starts in the mind it hasn't become sin yet it is uh a desire something that you want a feeling an emotion and if we don't don't have an immune system a spiritual immune system to address those things they can fester and turn into cancer a spiritual cancer and it's not the end of the world when you have cancer you just have to address it it's better to address it in the body or it's better to address it inside first before it be gets a hold amen you understand there's three steps uh the the UND detection and then it becoming so big that it's causing a problem now and of course cancer will will destroy uh the body and it will also spiritual cancer will destroy your soul and we don't want that amen so if we let sin overtake Our Lives it will destroy our spirit they say that cancer could be happening in your body right now it's normal for cells to go bad but the immune system comes and it it puts them you know gets rid of them cleans them up but it can get undetected and get out of hand so you need a strong immune system again and I encourage you as a Christian uh Jesus is giving us the answer here he's saying Watch and Pray so that you may not fall into temptation the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak weak so we don't want a weak immune system we want to be strong scripture say be strong in the Lord amen we want to have strength we want to have a good immune system that is fighting got to fight that battle and the things that we can do are those spiritual weapons the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but are Mighty and casting down strongholds right weapons of our Warfare are praying getting down on your knees during the week praying to God if you don't know how to pray uh David has written it down in Psalms and you can pray those prayers to help you get into in tune with God and pray the right prayer Bible says that his word is spirit reading his word is another spiritual weapon are you reading his word are you putting it into you scriptures say uh oh man I always mess that one up uh man does not live by bread of but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God Amen it's not just about eating food it's about it in taking in the word of God letting it affect you the word of God will affect you did you know that it's a spiritual weapon when you read it when you put it in you what's another spiritual weapon this morning we had opportunity to praise right out of the mouth of babes and suck or praise to still to stop the enemy and the Avenger if you want to a weapon you one of those weapons is praise praising God and so we want to use those things praying praise fasting uh seeking God putting his word into you assembling in the house of God hey Hallelujah you're here this morning amen yes important that we exercise and get a strong immune system we got to fight these things and so you have to recognize that if you're constantly doing what the flesh wants you will be weak it will weaken you amen so you have got to take time in your week take time in your day to strengthen your spiritual immune system to become strong in the Lord and if you don't you're going to live a life and be a weak Christian and we don't want that we don't want a weak immune system you want to be strong so we were talking last week about crime and this we're going to get back into it uh if we don't control the desires of the flesh um it can cause a lot of harm in Psalms 106:37 and in other places in the Bible says they even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to Demons and shed innocent blood the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan and the land was polluted with blood very bad awful things right we don't want to be doing these things in 2025 there's going to be an estimated 900,000 abortions California and New York are the top uh users of these things because those states are promoting it and allowing it um in 2022 40% of us births were the unmarried mothers and the statistics with a single parent home um uh well with regards to juveniles in PR prison 70% of juveniles in prison come from single parent homes kids from single parent homes that don't have a father it's they have a harder time in life and a good strong family should be the norm that's what we want to get back to that's what we got to start pushing for a good strong family 2024 education statistics 31% of eighth graders reading uh read proficiently 31% think about that that's a third a third of eighth graders are reading proficiently in our United States so we're not these innocent kids kids that were raising they're innocent they're innocent you know they're subject to what we're teaching them they can't read They're they're put in situations where they have to deal with a lot of problems and uh that people are also making decisions not even to bring them into the world because of selfishness and so if we don't control our selfishness our pride our natural desire for sex that desire for sex was put into you by God but you have to have some boundaries you may end up getting pregnant or getting someone pregnant and not being married and you have to make choices and people are making awful choices but the best way is to wait till you're married to have children that is best and that should be the norm uh again there's problems surrounding kids from single parent homes not that's just one of the statistics you can find more um and we've got to put some boundaries around sex because abortion stems from No Boundaries for on our sexual our natural sexual desire given to us by God remember that it's not wrong to desire the opposite sex but we have to have a boundary Deuteronomy 18:10 let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire who practices divination or sorcery interprets Omens engages in witchcraft or casts spells or who is a medium uh or spiri is who consults the dead you know these things these witchcraft things that we get into in America we just you know in America it's like oh let me try that let me try this let me try you know not everything is innocent folks It's Not Innocent uh I've got a picture up here it says the 13 principles of wiah the there's a book here wiah for beginners I'll show you the stats in the next slide but we're looking at what the scriptures say in Ephesians chapter 511 have no fellowship with the UNF unfruitful works of darkness but rather expose them it is shameful even to speak of those things which are done by them in secret so talking about uh witchcraft talking about all kinds of sinful things right we it's shameful we don't want any fellowship with those things we've got to we've got to have some distance between us and darkness in the world amen amen that that these Concepts come from the scriptures it's not just somebody trying to control you this is uh Paul Talking Paul is you know he's he's they're starting the church they've got to have these things in place you can't can't just go along engaging in different gods and pagan gods and and then saying you love Jesus no Jesus is a jealous God he wants your attention your alone your worship alone he doesn't want you doing seances and going to the party doing the the Witchcraft dance or whatever they do amen amen amen 2 in 2008 340,000 identified as Wiccan or Pagan and now 1.5 million uh in 2025 so it has they've gone up uh and they've grown quite a bit there are psychic fairs that you can go to protect um palm readings or protection spells with candles and you know they charge you money for this you know they they try to get money from you for or going to a palm reading psychic reading you know they want your money too and it's insincere it's connected to Darkness you don't want to be connected to Darkness Satan doesn't care about you Satan at the end he just wants you to die God wants to give you life what remember what the scripture said John 10:10 the thief has come to what steal kill and destroy but I have come Jesus Christ has come what to give us life and life what more abundant very important stick with Christ that's why Christ uh following him is better okay because if we're going to promote Satan in our time we're promoting the stealing we're promoting The Killing and destruction that's what's going to happen and that's the common sense of not allowing satanic stuff and darkness in 2025 uh let me skip that one the satanic temple TST with 700,000 unveiled bamit statues in Arkansas and after school Satan clubs in States like Ohio so if you guys look at the banner they got here they got a says the satanic T Temple after school Satan club and they all have their hands up like this and guess where this picture is from California San Clemy right over the hill s Clemen last year they're starting up a after school club and the the article says it's not what you think I mean come on after school Satan Club what uh we wanted to have another option other than God okay well now you just went you went way over to the other end you know not just uh you know enjoy life Club Club it's it's a Satan Club my good I mean come on that's Brazen anyway this is going on in our time we got to be smart here folks uh young people you got some decisions to make you got some influences out there you need to make sure you know what's going on all right don't be foolish don't be gullible uh be wise and so these things that are out there there and dabbling in witchcraft is not innocent and it's something we need to turn from amen uh remember we would go to youth group and i' take some kids home they're talking about oh they're going to have a seance and they're doing I'm like what are you what what are you guys doing no you don't want to do that uh these things aren't innocent uh there's the cultures that centered around themselves around uh uh Witchcraft and sorcery we don't we don't want to do that we want to walk away from that of such were some of you amen amen sexual immorality in 1 Corinthians 6:9 do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God so important this first statement right here is so powerful it opens up your brain okay Corinthians who wrote Corinthians Paul Paul they use Paul to say all kinds of things like you don't have to do anything good you just believe and then he says this statement do you not know that the what unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God we want to inherit the kingdom of God right we want to go to heaven amen amen and so it you know don't be deceived don't be tricked don't be tricked we don't want to be tricked and deceived either fornicators idolators adulterers homosexual sodomites thieves Covetous drunkards revilers extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God if we participate in these things it takes us to uh hell we will not inherit the kingdom of God first Corinthians again Paul saying flee sexual immorality he's begging us hey let's turn from this very important in 2025 uh the US culture normalizes casual sex on Tinder there's apps match.com Tinder uh there's 1.6 billion swipes daily billion I did not notice that billion swipes daily with hookups common so America has normalized casual sex uh we want you to know that the scriptures the Bible I'm got to play this video here oh yeah we'll get there we'll get there don't worry we just have to know this information you can choose to do with it what you want but I'm sharing with you the scriptures 2.6% of2 10.5% of Millennials and 20.8% of gen Z which means if we follow this trajectory we will all be gay in so Bill Maher he uh does not like Christians he does not like conservative Christians at all uh he doesn't like God I don't I don't know if he's an atheist or agnostic whatever but he normally he's opposing but he's pointing out something very important here and he's saying sharing the numbers based on uh the percentages the generations keep uh normalizing in their lives uh the lgbtq and saying that they're not what God created them to be and he was saying looking forward things are going to be uh worse let me open up another one here are people I can't emphasize this now there are not enough people I think one of the biggest risks to civilization is the low growth rate and the rapidly declining growth rate and yet so many people including smart people think that there are too many people in the world that think that the population is growing out of it's completely the opposite at the numbers people don't have children civilization not I can't all right so basically what I'm showing you here is this the secular people Elon Musk is not a Christian Bill Mah is not a Christian they're just pointing out the information they see right uh this homosexuality and and transgenderism that all if if it if we keep teaching the Next Generation these things and we keep pushing and promoting it it's going to end up hurting it it's hurting us it's hurting children it's hurting families the total fertility rate in 1960 was 3.65 so you got to have let's say you have a husband and wife right two people to replace or to keep growing the population you need to have at least two kids to keep it the same right so the number should be two to keep it going if you want to keep growing you have to be over two you've got to be like three so in the 60s is 3.65 so we were on a good path we were growing in America the total fertility rate now in this year is what 1.79 so we are going down we are not having kids people that are uh educated and fluent are less likely to have children and this is the rate of reproduction in America right now 1.79 and Elon Musk is pointing something out as well he's saying the world is saying oh there's too many people we're overpopulated he's saying that's not true it's the exact opposite we need more people and he's right looking at the numbers he's pointing out something very important here and so we got to get back to a strong family 1960 strong family we had problems in 1960 but we didn't have a family problem now we got a family problem uh this when I was younger this used to be one of our arguments that if uh homosexuality if you if you use it across and if you um have if everybody's a homosexual then there's no people in the Next Generation uh and people would laugh be like that's never going to happen but well we're on our way we're on our way to that that's not good it's harming it's going to harm the Next Generation and so Society in movies and schools and in and more are teaching lgbtq uh Concepts promoting it and teaching those behaviors as normal but it's doing harm folks um aside from the genal genital mutilation we already went went over that in the past very important that we understand the cost Associated the harm that is done uh there's a big consequence as a sin against God God is saying it's a sin and the STD is involved and the harm to society as we're seeing here amen Matthew 19:4 at the beginning the Creator made them what male and female common sense right these con ceps work male and female for this reason a man should leave his father and mother be United to his wife because God has made male and female the way to make this happen to the way keep reproducing is to get what married Hebrews chapter 13:4 say it with me marriage is what honorable among all and the marriage bed undefiled but fornicators and adulterers God will judge poor important for us to know that we don't want to be deceived these are things that we want to turn away from Genesis 126 God blessed them and said to them be fruitful and increase in number fill the Earth and subdue it there's movies out and Concepts out they're trying to tell us to stop uh uh populating the world that we're overpopulating God told us from the beginning what fill the Earth multiply and fill the Earth We're following what God told us and remember Satan doesn't want any more people in heaven than are already going to heaven right so if he can get you to stop you know multiplying and filling the Earth that's also part of his b but it's important you know Elon must promotes having kids but he doesn't get married and he doesn't stick with one person you know according to God's word want to get married and stick with one person and keep serving God uh teaching training our children the way they should go very important we want to be examples to our children we can and so getting back to the concept we were sharing how cancer and sin are very similar cancer can go undetected in the body and it does happen and sin uh starts in the mind and if you have a strong immune system spiritually that means that you are praying reading putting God's word into you when you pray also it's a spiritual weapon that you can use fasting is a spiritual weapon uh what's the other praise we had an opportunity again to worship this morning praising God these are spiritual weapons to keep your immune system strong it's not like you can't ever have a bad thought and to expect you not to have a bad thought is a little extreme you're going to have a bad thought right but your immune system is there that spiritual immune system come hey you need to fix that you need to adjust that remember we talked about Cain and God came to Cain he said hey I I see the hatred in your heart if you don't address it you are going to if you don't Master it sin is going to wreck you and that's the way sin is if you don't deal with it in your heart if you don't repent from it and get away from those things it's going to wreck you and in the case of this example here cancer will uh come out and start to destroy your spirit just like the natural body so what is the solution for cancer in our natural bodies it has to be what what what it has to be killed cancer has to be killed at least right now this is what we find these are the solutions you have to kill cancer and the cells are very rapidly dividing cells so chemotherapy and radiation um are used to kill those cancerous cells the problem with chemo and radiation is what makes you sick because it's killing everything else right it kills good cells too now let's set that aside that's not part of this example Colossians 213 he forgave us all our sins he has taken it away nailing it to the cross say that with me nailing it to the Cross so he takes your sin and he takes he gets it up there and Wham take that Romans 66 our old self was what crucified with him so that the body ruled by sin might be done away so that body that was cancerous with sin and dying might be done away with we need to be born again why because the old man is dying do we it makes sense to me it makes sense you know sin is like cancer we got to get that cancerous body out of here I want to live in a New and Living Way amen I want to live free from that junk Hallelujah and and Jesus he'll nail it to the Cross get out of here our old self was crucified with him is that because he doesn't like you is that because he's trying to be mean no he wants to save you he wants to change you but we have to let God kill that old sinful man we have to be willing to come to him very important so there is also remission right we know about this word remission amen have you heard of that my cancer is in remission uh just talk to Adam he knows all about it right you can tell us everything he had cancer and right and uh remission is meaning it's all gone and it's not coming back and we want sin to be gone and not coming back we want to talk about that right now real quick and REM the remission of cancer smoking is the leading cause of preventable cancer worldwide responsible for about 22% of cancer deaths the uh IR list I didn't look up what that was but alcohol also is a cause of cancers in the mouth the throat esophagus liver colon and breast cancer even moderate drinking so when what I'm what I'm saying is that there's thing called called car carcinogens have you heard that things that cause cancer so we got it all killed with chemo we got all the radiation done all right it's in remission and then we go pick up carcinogens and we put them into our body what do you think is going to happen you're inviting it all back and it's the same way in our spirit Jesus Christ has nailed that old man to the cross that sinful man to the Cross he's killed he's put it behind us and he is saying we can now walk in a New and Living Way but we invite it right back and it's going to come back all that sin that hurt is it's going to come back we're inviting the cancer back in we don't want to do that this is also some natural information for you okay if you if you're going to drink it's going to you're opening up the door in your natural body for cancer okay these things remission of sin so we talked about the remission of cancer how to keep it out of you how to keep uh on a path of you know staying keeping cancer out of your body and how do you keep the cancer out of your spirit acts chap 2:38 repent say that word with me repent that means we turn away from we stopped doing the sin the thief on the cross you know what his repentance was going to be if he didn't die was that he stopped stealing right that's repentance you don't do it anymore you turn from it let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the what say it with me remission remission the eradication getting rid of it repent be baptized commit to Christ amen young people you got to understand when you are baptized you are making commitment to Christ I remember when I was 12 and I got baptized I was making a commitment to Christ very important very powerful and what are we repenting from We're repenting from all those things in Galatians 5:19 you can go look it up as I already expressed in slides before we repent from we turn from those things and there are are also sins that are not leading to death there's there's sins that don't lead to hell okay what's listed here what's for example what's not listed is cursing or swearing you know it's a sin but it doesn't take you to hell but you need to it's not still not good I don't want to be repeating what Satan would say amen amen and James talks about how we got to control and tame the tongue you you these are things we got to work on we never say oh it's okay it's not a hell sin I get to do it that's not the perspective we got to have amen amen so we want to turn from these things 1 John 2 verse1 if anyone sins we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous believe it or not when you get that old man nailed to the cross and you got Jesus cleansing you and you're walking in a New Living Way guess what you might mess up and if you do do you give up no you go to Christ The Advocate with the father say Jesus I got some cancer on me again I need your help I need your cleansing I need that cleansing I need that cancer out of me please so we have Solutions that's what I'm trying to point out today there are great Solutions in God if you've never accepted Christ and you feel that the weight of your sin is too high there is no weight there is no sin there is no rejection of Jesus or sin that you've done that's going to keep you from his amazing cross his death on the cross his blood can cleanse it says from all sin and as Christians we have this great tool that if we are willing to repent and keep repenting it's not just a one- time thing you got to keep repenting because there's different things oh man you got a mouth on you you curse like a sailor you grew up cursing like a sailor you keep repenting you keep changing hold on I think I yeah that's good and so what can we do Romans 8 looking forward Romans 8 chapter 1 says therefore there is therefore now no condemnation you don't got to feel condemned you know Jesus nailed it on the cross he you are crucified with him you're walking in a you're born again you're walking in a New and Living Way uh it says therefore no condemnation to those who are what in Christ Jesus and the question today is what are you in are you into witchcraft are you into sin are you into uh all kinds of sexual immorality are you into yourself are you into some group are you into what are you into are you in the biggest question is what are you in what Christ how do I be in in Christ well you got to put him in you you put his word in you you get down on your knees and get him in you the scriptures say that he inhabits the Praises of his people the scriptures say that we are the Temple of the Holy Spirit if you spend all your life pushing him out of you not making time for him to come in then you got a problem you're not you're not in Christ you got to get him into you who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit um pretty plain right there okay someone who is in Christ is someone who doesn't walk according to the flesh you know they don't go around thinking what sin can I do next they say I need to I need to follow the spirit what the spirit says what the spirit wants to do Hallelujah Romans 12:12 2 sorry 12 ver2 do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God again another scripture uh encouraging us again saying what are we conforming to are we conforming to the world what are we in are we in the world is everything about us all the world the world I want to be like the world I want to do what the world does we're conforming to the world the world says this so I'm going to do it that's conforming to the world right but Paul writing to the Romans here saying be what what transformed what's that transformation Jesus nailed the old man you're walking in a New and Living Way now I've been transformed I used to talk this way but now I talk this way I talk right I speak good things I speak well I've been transformed my mouth has been transformed my behavior has been transformed Jesus has made a transformation Hallelujah we want to be transformed and it says that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God do we have any desire to do God's will do you have any desire to do what he says to do to do what he wants you to do in your life it's if it's all about you my friend you need to check your priorities you need to rethink what you're doing last week we brought up a nation overwhelmed by crime we showed you that this small country had a civil war not too long ago in the 70s and the 90s and it's government and uh between the government and the leftist gorillas 75,000 people Di died in this war it shattered the nation's economy and social fabric 2% of the population had 95% of the income people lived in poverty no jobs no stability 100,000 people from this nation fled to the United States the Youth of the Nation formed Gams gangs MS13 and bario 18 The Gangs grew in Los Angeles and the the war ended in 1992 the Civil War and 4,000 gang members were deported back to this nation and the government there didn't control them and the gangs Grew From 4,000 to 60,000 by 2000s and so they just endured a Civil War and after the Civil War was over the The Gangs came back and they started to increase and the gangs controlled 247 of the 262 municipalities by 2016 this is just 10 years ago they controlled 247 of 262 M municipalities the gains the bad people they extorted vendors businesses killed with impunity and forced kids to join or die as I shared last week and the nation hit a peak of murders with 6,656 murders in a population of 6 million that's the high highest homicide rate in the world the average person couldn't even cross the street and I'm going to show you why I bring this up this is a quintessential example of crime and the harm from crime 2019 buou took office he was voted in and he started to arrest these gang members that were causing harm 85,000 by March 20 2025 and the homic homicides by 2024 plummeted to 114 a rate of 1.89 which was down 98% from 2015 so 98 2015 with the highest rate in the world it went down by 2024 to 98% in 2025 at at this time there were only have only been 12 murders with 58 days homicide free and the nation this nation has become Latin America's safest nation in just a few years in 2015 they were they were that had the highest homicide rate in the world and now they're the safest nation in Latin America that is a change folks the critics come at this guy and they say oh there's human rights violations over 1% of the PE population is jailed how could you do this and his response is where were you when we lost 30 people a day you weren't crying then when our nation was in turmoil and are you going to criticize me for cleaning this up that a nation now reports Freedom kids play outside businesses Thrive because harmful issues were rejected I asked uh if he had any statements about God and he had many and one of them was we achieve the unimaginable with the glory of God and with his wisdom I bring this nation up because it's a witness to All Nations that the people can rise up they can find someone to vote in that is good and change the situation in their country for the most part you know you you are dealing with other countries where they have a very big hold but in this nation these guys you know they got together they they they got the votes and they voted them in and it's a witness because also they put some practices in place to change what was happening in their country and so all the excuses that we have throughout the world of oh we can't do this or we can't change this it's not true he just did they just did it in five years and whatever excuse you may have about changing for Christ Christ has more power than buou he has more power than any natural solution in this world there's no excuse and there are people that are repenting and turning and following Christ with all of their heart and there's no excuse for us Jesus says that he will take your sin and nail it Jesus says that he will transform you it's time we got get rid of the excuses this nation is a witness to All Nations and so God is asking us have we come to Christ to kill that sin and cancer in our lives have you come for him to do that in your life sorry about that have we repented from our sin to keep sin in remission amen you understand that Christ is the power to completely cleanse you to completely get your sin into remission but we also have a choice are we going to keep it in remission and that is done by repenting and turning amen and if it comes back we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ is the righteous right it doesn't have to control us doesn't have to take over our bodies we are our spiritual man we can rise up we can get back with Christ get cleaned up and keep moving forward Hallelujah and lastly are we conforming to the world or are we being transformed by Christ we don't have excuses folks Jesus Christ is so powerful remember in the beginning he said let there be light and there was what light he said let it happen and it happened amen Christ has so much power he can change your life so important for us to recog recognize that and so we have to make some choices we've got to be transformed by Jesus Christ I encourage you this morning as they keep playing right now we just want to take a moment and as we shared with earlier we want to take some time to repent we have things in our areas in our lives that we need to repent from amen and we want to come before God and just say Jesus we pray for your forgiveness we pray God that you would take this from us so let's come before him right now lift up our voices and repent unto him Lord Jesus we come before you Lord God we thank you for your death on the cross Lord Jesus we thank you for what you've done in our lives Jesus God we come before you Lord and we pray that you would come take our sin Lord Jesus nail it to the Cross we thank you Lord God we can come boldly to your throne throne of grace the scriptures say we can come boldly before the the throne of grace Lord God that you will Lord Jesus change us Lord we can repent and turn from sin Lord Jesus we thank you God that you have created and made these things for us Lord God we bring them to you we lift them up to you Lord Jesus Lord we thank you this morning God oh Lord I Repent Lord God lord I pray Jesus cleanse my heart cleanse my soul my body everything Lord God we come before you right now Jesus Jesus we invite you Jesus Lord
